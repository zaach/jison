Name: Jison Parser Php Port
Written By: Robert Plummer, RobertLeePlummerJr@gmail.com
Description: A jison wrapper that first processes a jison file and then injects a php template with the variables from a .js file.

DIRECTIONS:
1. After you've downloaded jison & node.js, navigate in command line interface to the folder that containes the ".jison" file that you want to process
2. Process the ".jison" file like this "node /location_of_jison/ports/php/jison.js my_jison_file.jison"

CONFIGURATION:
Configuration is a bit obscure since we have both php and javascript in the same file, for the time being:
*A line in your ".jison" file that has a "//js" artefact AFTER it is removed in the php parser.
*A line in your ".jison" file that has a "//php" artefact BEFORE it is uncommented in the php parser.
*A line in your ".jison" file that has no artefact, is left alone.
*Comments in the ".jison" file that start with "//phpOption" can be used to configure the output of the php file.
**//phpOption parserClass:Name_Of_Parser_Class will change the parser class from "Parser"
**//phpOption lexerClass:Name_Of_Lexer_Class will change the parser class from "Lexer"
**//phpOption fileName:Name_Of_File.php  will change the php filename

EXAMPLE:
contents
 : content
	{$$ = $1;} //<--this is left alone
 | contents content
	{
		$$ =  Wiki.join($1, $2); //js <--this is stripped in the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser
		
		//php $$ = JisonParser_Wiki_Handler::join($1, $2); <-- this is uncommented from the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser
	}
 ;
