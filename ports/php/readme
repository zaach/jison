Name: Jison Parser Php Port
Written By: Robert Plummer, RobertLeePlummerJr@gmail.com
Description: A jison wrapper that first processes a jison file and then injects a php template with the variables from a .js file.

DIRECTIONS:
1. After you've downloaded jison & node.js, navigate in command line interface to the folder that contains the ".jison" file that you want to process
2. Process the ".jison" file like this "nodejs /location_of_jison/ports/php/php.js my_jison_file.jison"

CONFIGURATION:
Configuration takes advantage of the commenting in javascript so as not to conflict with.
*In your ".jison" file
**A that has a "//js" comment BEFORE the javascript line starts a javascript area of the parser section.  Which will be removed from the php.
**A line that simply has "//" ends whatever commenting is currently active.
**A that has a "//php" comment ON the line of php it starts a php area of the parser section.  In Javascript this is just a comment, in php though, the comment is removed so that it can be called.
**A that has no comment, is left alone.
*Comments in the ".jison" file that start with "//option" can be used to configure the output of the php file.
**//option optionName:value
**Current Options:
*** "namespace" - default is "Jison"
*** "class" - default is your ".jison" file without the file extension
*** "fileName" - default is your ".jison" file without the file extension followed by ".php"

EXAMPLE:
contents
 : content
    {$$ = $1;} //<--this is left alone
 | contents content
    {
        //js
        $$ = join($1, $2); //<--this is stripped in the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser

        //php $$ = $SomeClass->someMethod($1, $2); //<-- this is uncommented from the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser

        /*php
            $$ = $SomeClass->someMethod($1, $2); //<-- this is uncommented from the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser
        */

        /* If you'd like to just strip out the javascript and do nothing else, you can do the following: */
        //js
            $$ = join($1, $2); //<--this is stripped in the php parser, no action taken in the javascript parser
        //
    }
 ;
