// Sourcecode template for the P-code interpreter: this is a very basic
// bottom-up tree walker, or a very basic CPU simulation, if you are 
// inclined to look at it that way.
//
// The key here is that the 'sorcerer' tree-walker has run before and
// produced a suitable AST token stream for my kind particularly: me, I
// don't do 'shift', not really, I only do 'reduce', so the 'sorcerer'
// has to inject the 'which bits in there need shifting?' knowledge into
// the AST so that these points in the flow show up as 'reduce' actions
// for me. Of course, you may find a bit strange to talk about 'shift'
// and 'reduce' when we already seem to have left the grammar/language 
// realm in here, running some kind of 'assembly code' disguised as an
// 'AST token stream': yes, this is a classic 'tape', but 'assembly code'
// is itself yet another language, though probably a very simple one (SLR(0)?)
// and I want to emphasize the fact that you are **still** working with
// a language, hence a *grammar*, in here; you just happened to have
// translated language A (AST token stream produced by the expression parser)
// into language B (AST token stream which looks very much like 'assembly code'
// as produced by the 'sorcerer' tree walker).
//
// How do you develop such a beast?
//
// First, I came up with the P-code runner, a.k.a. 'interpreter' and checked
// if my ideas about fast and faster code actually worked more or less.
// Once that had been nailed down, I thus knew what 'assembly language' I
// had to feed this P-code interpreter and *that* drives the translation/transposition
// activity required from the 'sorcerer' middleware, so that one has
// been next. 
//
// After that, it's a couple of iterations to get everything working to my
// satisfaction, which I'ld say would be possibly be 'Agile' this day and age,
// but I say it's correct application of the control engineering feedback loop model
// (or Waterfall Model of old, just to get your knickers in a twist)   :-)
//
// Anyway, the key element is that the P-code runner must be as fast as possible,
// hence have the least bit of overhead, and we can help a lot accomplishing 
// just that by making sure we pick a better format for our 'incoming' P-code
// stream.


// critical condition: the P-code stream input is to be treated as **immutable**
// so it can be re-used time and again!
