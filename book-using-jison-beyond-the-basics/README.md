## What will you find in here?

Following a quick introduction on (LR & LALR) grammar design and compilation using YACC/BISON-like tools such as JISON, this book addresses advanced topics in LALR and LR grammar construction available when using JISON.

Related topics in both parsing theory and parsing practice are addressed alongside to ensure this can serve as a refresher book while you work with JISON and consider your options, including the question if using JISON or any LALR/LR-type parser generator at all is a *Smart Choice™* under your given circumstances -- too often books about tools or technologies neglects the alternatives: not so here.
