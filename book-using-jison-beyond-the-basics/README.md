# Preface 

## Target Audience

Language architects and grammar designers. Grammar coders. Folks curious about JISON and more or less aware of what is available out there: you have worked with `yacc` and `lex` and you have looked beyond.


> WARNING

> This is not for novices who are writing their first parser _ever_. Though this book includes introduction material it is no substitute for your CS101 Compiler Construction class. Just in case you haven't attended that one, you may want to [consult a few referenced books](A_JISON_Specifics_Reference.md#Reference_Materials) while you go through this book.

## What will you find in here?

Following a quick introduction on (LR & LALR) grammar design and compilation using YACC/BISON-like tools such as JISON, this book addresses advanced topics in LALR and LR grammar construction available when using JISON.

Related topics in both parsing theory and parsing practice are addressed alongside to ensure this can serve as a refresher book while you work with JISON and consider your options, including the question if using JISON or any LALR/LR-type parser generator at all is a *Smart Choiceâ„¢* under your given circumstances -- too often books about tools or technologies neglect the alternatives: not so here.
